# **Marketing Brief: Innovative Digital Campaign for Conner Mac**

**Project Overview**

In the competitive landscape of political campaigning, the objective is to develop a digital marketing strategy for Conner Mac, a congressional democratic candidate. The campaign aims to leverage a $1.2 million budget to implement innovative and effective outreach strategies, diverging from traditional Get Out the Vote (GOTV) methods that primarily target voters with a history of voting.

**Target Audience**

Our data-driven approach identifies the following key demographic segments for engagement:

**Educational Levels** 

**Highly educated individuals** (graduate, bachelor, vocational degrees) with a focus on job creation and vocational opportunities.

**Mid-income earners** ($75,000 - $250,000+) and low-income earners ($15,000 - $75,000) who exhibit significant voting frequencies.

**Young working-class voters** (ages 18-35) active online but underrepresented in voter turnout.

**Income Bracket:**

**Mixed-gender and female-only households**, particularly suburban women who are often swing voters concerned with healthcare, education, and family welfare.

**Ethnic Groups:**

**Diverse communities**, including European ethnicity, African American, and Hispanic voters, tailored messaging to address their specific challenges and interests.

**Age of Voter Registration:**

**Both long-registered voters and newly registered**, tech-savvy young voters who are responsive to digital media.
